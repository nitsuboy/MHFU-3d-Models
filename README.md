# MHFU 3d Models
 almost all Monster Hunter freedom unite models
 extracted and converted using automated [svanheulen conversors](https://github.com/svanheulen/mhff)

some of the models are with wrong normals or just straight up corrupted, and dosent have any type of identification for now, but if you want to improve the models or categorize them, go ahead !!

nothing that blender and some time cant do.

i recomend [F3D](https://f3d.app/) to get a quick view of all models
